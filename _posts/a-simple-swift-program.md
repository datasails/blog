To be able to try the following piece of Swift code you will need Xcode 6 (currently in beta) or later.

```
var a = 2
let b = 40
var result = a + b
var output = "The answer is \(result)"

//Semicolons at the end of the line are optional
println(result);
```

We have a variable 'a' and a constant 'b'. We have a string variable 'output' and no semicolon at the end of the line.
